## Codebase Patterns
- Two copies of base.html exist: `src/templates/base.html` (primary, used by Flask app) and `templates/base.html` (legacy root copy) — both must be kept in sync
- CSS variables are defined in `:root` in base.html's inline `<style>` block — no external CSS files
- Theme toggle CSS and JS are co-located in base.html (not separate files)
---

## 2026-02-03 - US-001
- Replaced `:root` dark theme CSS variable values with light theme values in both base.html files
- Removed `[data-theme="light"]` CSS override block (values now in `:root`)
- Removed `.theme-toggle` CSS styles and `[data-theme="light"] .theme-toggle` rules
- Removed `data-theme="dark"` attribute from `<html>` element
- Files changed: `src/templates/base.html`, `templates/base.html`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Both `src/templates/base.html` and `templates/base.html` must be edited in sync — the root copy is a legacy duplicate
  - mypy has 60 pre-existing errors in `tools/` and `src/` Python files — these are not introduced by template changes
  - Template (HTML/Jinja2) files are not checked by mypy, only Python source
